"""How each input a rule reads is built from the database's queries, for one decoded subject.

An input a specification governs is built governance first: when no specification governs the subject for the
input, its builder returns `Ungoverned` without asking for the facts the input would hold, so an ungoverned subject
never pays for them. Only then does it ask the queries, each computed once per subject however many rules read the
input. An input the package governs, such as a skill's line count, has no governance to read, so its builder asks
the queries straight away and never returns `Ungoverned`.

A builder takes the decode query's witness, never a bare ref, so an input of a file that does not decode cannot be
asked for. The runner builds an input only when an enabled rule reads it.
